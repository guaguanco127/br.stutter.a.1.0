## <a name="About"></a>About

This is an abstraction for Max/MSP that is built around the Max/MSP stutter~ object. A real-time granular glitch effect that is a signal capture buffer.

For a more complex version of this effect, try [br.stutter.a.1.0](https://github.com/guaguanco127/br.stutter.a.1.0) or [br.stutter.c.1.0](https://github.com/guaguanco127/br.stutter.c.1.0)
  
**On/Off:** When Stutter is turned on, the signal is interrupted and a history of the signal is repeated based on the grain size. 

**Button:** While the stutter is on, pressing the button acts like a re-trigger, capturing another grain of the live signal that was fed into the stutter at the time, regardless of what the stutter was just playing. There is no feedback option. 

**Speed:** The playback speed of the grains. 1.0 is the default and is normal speed. Negative speeds play the grains backwards. The range is a float from -32.0 and 32.0. 

**Latent Mode:** When "Latent" is on, the stutter waits to record the next grain of sound before switching to the next stutter sound. The latency is equal to the next grain size. This is a valuable feature because it captures what comes next, as opposed to what already has come and gone. Turning the latent mode off captures the previous grain size prior to pressing the re-trigger button. The default is on. 

**Mix Mode:** There are two mix modes, "Gate" and "Insert" with "Gate being the default. "Gate" allows the dry unaffected signal to pass through while the stutter effect is turned off. The dry signal then mutes once the stuter is turnes on. This feature is best in an effects chain. The "Insert" mode does not allow any dry signal to pass through while the stutter effect is turned off. Instead, you only hear the grains play once the effect is turned on. This feature is useful for auxilliary effect return tracks. 

**Size:** The size, in milliseconds, of the current grain that is playing. "Size 1" is compared with "Size 2" and a random size is chosen between these two parameters. The range is between 5 ms and 1000 ms. This is only a meter that tells you its size, you cannot adjust it. 

**Size 1:** The first potential size timings. "Size 1" is compared with "Size 2" and a random size is chosen between these two parameters. The range is between 5 ms and 1000 ms. The default is set to 5 ms.

**Size 2:** The second potential size timings. "Size 1" is compared with "Size 2" and a random size is chosen between these two parameters. The range is between 5 ms and 1000 ms. The default is set to 1000 ms.



## <a name="Install"></a>How To Install 

1. Make sure you have Max/MSP 8 installed in your computer. And, make sure you are using a Max patch that is inside of a folder.  

2. Copy and paste br.stutter.a.abs.1.0.maxpat inside of the same folder as the Max patch you are using.    

3. In the Max patch you are using, create an object called br.stutter.a.abs.1.0 

5. Alternatively, you could also create this inside of a bpatcher object and use all of the preset UI objects featured inside the abstraction. To do this, create a bpatcher object. Then, go inside of its inspector, select "choose" next to "Patcher File" and select the br.munge.abs.1.0.maxpat located within the same folder as your project. 

## <a name="Use"></a>How To Use

Read the "Above" section and inspect each inlet of the abstraction.
